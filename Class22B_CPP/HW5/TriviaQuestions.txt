An object is, conceptually, a self-contained unit consisting of
Attributes (data) and procedures (functions)
Attributes
Procedures
Data
Encapsulation refers to
Combining data and code into a single object
Storing data into an object
Creating functions for an object
Protecting data
Data hiding refers to an object’s ability to
Hide its data from code that is outside the object
Hide its data from code that is inside the object
Hide its data
Hide its procedures
A class is not an object, but it is
A description of an object
An instance of an object
Code that specifies the attributes that a particular type of object may have
Code that specifies the functions that a particular type of object may have
An object is not a class, but it is
An instance of a class
A description of a class
Code that specifies the attributes that a class may have
Code that specifies the functions that a class may have
The operator that identifies the function as a member of a class is
::
:
->
.
The complete name of the operator that identifies the function as a member of a class is
Scope resolution operator
Scope operator
Identification operator
Scope identification operator
Some programmers refer to mutators as
Setter functions
Getter functions
Change functions
Accessor functions
Some programmers refer to accessors as
Getter functions
Setter functions
Change functions
Mutators functions
To dynamically allocate an object we can use
a pointer
a default constructor
constructor
the class specification file
A class can have more than one constructor
if a class  have different parameter lists
if a class  have same parameter lists
only if it has no default constructor
False
In UML you indicate  with a minus (-)
a private member
a public member
a function has no return value
a default constractor
Place member function definitions in
.cpp file
.h file
.txt file
.o  file
If you write a class with no constructor at all
C++ will write a default constructor for you
file will not compile and run
you will have the fatal error
the program will not cmpiled
