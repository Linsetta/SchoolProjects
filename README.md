# SchoolProjects

* [Class 22B CPP](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class22B_CPP/HW5): Intermediate Programming Methodologies in C++

> A systematic approach to the design, construction and management of
> computer programs, emphasizing design, programming style,
> documentation, testing and debugging techniques. Strings,
> multidimensional arrays, structures, and classes. Pointers: their
> use in arrays, parameters and dynamic allocation. Introduction to
> linked lists. Software engineering and computer science students are
> the targeted group.

* [Class 22C CPP](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class22C_CPP): Data Abstraction and Structures

> Application of software engineering techniques to the design and
> development of large programs; data abstraction and structures and
> associated algorithms: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs,
> and hash tables; internal and external sorting; use of recursion;
> team project.

* [De Anza 26B: Advanced C Programming](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class26B_C)

> Applications of advanced features of C and the C-library functions
> including: binary and random-access input/output, dynamic data
> structures, bit manipulation, string parsing and string-to-numeric
> conversion, event and error processing, function pointers,
> recursion, and variable-length argument list functions.

* [De Anza 35B: Advanced Java Programming](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class35B_Java)

> Emphasis on foundation technologies in Java that enable you to write
> server side programs in Java. Concepts include inner classes,
> exceptions, file I/O, reflections, cloning, multi-threading, Java
> FX, Web Programming with Java Server Pages, Servlets, JavaServer
> Faces and JavaBeans.

* [De Anza 41A: Python Programming](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class41A_Python/HW)

> A complete introduction to the Python language. Topics covered
> include: primitive and collection data types, operators and
> statements, loops and branching, functions and variable scoping,
> modules and packages, object oriented programming, file handling,
> regular expressions and exception handling

* [De Anza 41JA: Introduction to x86 Processor Assembly Language and Computer Architecture](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Class41JA_ASM/HW)

> Introduction to the syntax and semantics of the x86 processor
> assembly language, standard instruction set, selected macros and
> directives, x86 architecture.

* [UC Santa Cruz CMPS101: Algorithms and Abstract Data Types](https://github.com/Linsetta/SchoolProjects/tree/master/ClassCS101_C)

> Studies basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract
> data types. Covers the notions of abstract data types and the
> distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of
> that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using
> asymptotic (big "O") notation is emphasized. Topics include sorting
> and searching techniques, basic graph algorithms, and algorithm
> design techniques. Abstract data types covered include priority
> queues, dictionaries, disjoint sets, heaps, balanced trees, and
> hashing. Familiarity with C, Java, and Unix is assumed.
